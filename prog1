 Procedure
 1. Configure VirtualBox Network for Packet Capture
 o Open VirtualBox → Kali VM → Settings → Network.
 o Set Adapter 1:
  Attached to: Bridged Adapter
  Promiscuous Mode: Allow All
  Cable Connected: ✔️
 o Save settings.
 2. Start Kali Linux VM
 o Boot the Kali Linux VM in VirtualBox.
 3. Run Wireshark as Root
 sudo wireshark
 o Select network interface eth0 
4. Start Packet Capture
 o Click on eth0 to begin capturing packets.
 o Generate some traffic (open websites, ping servers, or run curl commands).
5. Apply Display Filters for Analysis
 Examples:
 o DNS Packets:
 dns
 o HTTPS Packets:
 tls
 o Packets from specific IP:
 ip.addr == 18.161.216.37
 o TCP Port 443:
 tcp.port == 443
6. Analyze Captured Packets
 o Select any packet and expand:
  Ethernet Layer: Source & Destination MAC addresses
  IP Layer: Source & Destination IP addresses
  TCP/UDP Layer: Port numbers, flags (SYN, ACK)
  Application Layer: Protocol details (DNS query, HTTP request, TLS 
handshake)
7. Stop Capture and Save
 o Stop capture (red square button).
 o Save capture file in .pcap format for submission.
Part B: Capturing Login Credentials over HTTP
 Step 1 – Setup Apache Web Server
 sudo service apache2 start
 sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/testlogin
 cd /var/www/html/testlogin
 Step 2 – Create Login HTML Page
 sudo nano login.html
 html
 CopyEdit
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
    <title>Test Login Page</title>
 </head>
 <body>
    <h2>Login Form</h2>
    <form action="login.php" method="post">
        Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br><br>
        Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
 </body>
 </html>
 Save (Ctrl + O → Enter → Ctrl + X).
 Step 3 – Create PHP Script
 sudo nano login.php
 php
 CopyEdit
 <?php
 $username = $_POST['username'];
 $password = $_POST['password'];
 echo "<h2>Login Attempt</h2>";
 echo "Username: " . $username . "<br>";
 echo "Password: " . $password . "<br>";
 ?>
 Step 4 – Start/Enable Apache
 sudo service apache2 status
 sudo service apache2 start
 Step 5 – Test Page
 Browser:
 http://127.0.0.1/testlogin/login.html
Or: Type in bash
 curl http://127.0.0.1/testlogin/login.html
 Step 6 – Capture with Wireshark
  Open Wireshark → select lo (loopback) interface.
  Start capture.
  Apply filter:
 http.request.method == "POST"
Step 7 – Perform Login Attempt
  Username: admin
  Password: test123
  Submit form.
 Step 8 – Analyze Packets
  Locate POST packet.
  Right-click → Follow → TCP Stream.
  Credentials will be visible in plain text.
Observations
  Network traffic from various applications can be captured in real-time.
  Protocol filters help narrow down the traffic of interest.
  Details such as source/destination IP, MAC addresses, ports, and application data can 
be examined.
  HTTP POST requests transmit data in plaintext.
  Credentials can be directly read in the captured packets when using HTTP.
  Using HTTPS would encrypt this data and prevent such interception.
 Post-Lab Discussion
  Bridged Adapter mode allows the VM to be part of the physical network, enabling 
packet sniffing.
  Promiscuous mode is essential to capture packets not directly addressed to the 
capturing machine.
 HTTPS traffic is encrypted, so packet payloads are unreadable without decryption 
keys.
  HTTP lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to credential theft.
  Tools like Wireshark can be used by attackers to sniff sensitive data if encryption is 
not in place.
  Transitioning to HTTPS mitigates this risk by encrypting data in transit.
  The loopback interface captures traffic within the local system (127.0.0.1)
